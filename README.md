# Preference Game

This project was built during the 2013 Australian Federal election to visualise
the preference tickets in the Senate. It was a collaboration betwen
the OpenAustralia Foundation and The Global Mail with data from Below The Line.
The project is being open-sourced so that it can be reused in future elections.

Please make sure you understand the limitations of this visualisation before
using it. It is a simplified model of preference deals and it doesn't take into
account factors such as split tickets. The dynamic physics engine also means that 
the distance between the parties may change with interaction.

Please submit a github issue if you have any questions.

## Instructions

This visualisation opens showing Australia’s relative political relationships
this election — the closer two parties are in their preference deals, the
closer they appear to each other — and vice versa.

Click on any party and watch its preferences flow in (numbered) order
underneath. (Notice some skipped numbers? The party above must have several
candidates.)

Where a party splits its ticket, it shows up like circle with diagonal lines. This visualisation uses
the first ticket only. Visit http://belowtheline.org.au for more detail on how the
other tickets would play out. For psephologist Antony Green's guide, read

Oh, and just for fun, whip them around and show them who’s boss in a democracy.
